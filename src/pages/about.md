**I love computers and code.** I've been at it for a long time and I continue to challege myself every day!

**I work as a full-stack developer** for Gray Television, a leading media company. I'm interested in many languages, but my current jam is React, Node, and PHP.

##### A Little More...

**I've worked in the technology side of media & entertainment since 2010** when I was hired at a small market TV station (WBKO). 
I started as a cameraman for the evening news and eventually went on to become a technical director. I knew I wanted latch on
to the digital side of TV, so I invested in learning automation, graphics technology, and scripting for the modern newscast.

**In 2015, I was hired as a Digital Solutions Specialist** for the parent company of WBKO, Gray Television. I was responsible for supporting
the campany's digital products, building & maintaining websites, as well as providing training.

**In 2018, I was promoted to Digital Engineer at Gray Television.** I am currently responsible for developing internal company software, third party
integrations, and maintaining infastructure. I get to use many differnet languages on the job, but I am primarily working in PHP & JS (React) at
the moment.

Outside of my professional life, I like to play and record music. I've played drums in various bands over the years and have recorded many albums for myself and others. 
Audio Engineering is my biggest hobby outside of computers. I also like to drink beer and hike, which is a big reason I love living in Colorado!

Even though I've come a long way since 2010 when being introduced to TV & Digital, **I am still learning and growing every day** as a software developer and person.
If you have any questions or just want to talk, please reach out to me. I love learning about what other people do and telling my own story to those
that want to hear it. Thanks for reading!
