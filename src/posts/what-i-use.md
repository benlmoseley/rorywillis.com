After seeing several others make a "uses" page, I wanted to create my own. This is heavily inspired by [Adam Wathan's site](https://adamwathan.me/uses/).

### Hardware

**Macbook Pro 15 inch 2019**

I recently upgraded to the 15 inch MBP after using a 13 inch for a long time. I wasn't sure it would be portable enough, but it's not really a huge a difference and the extra power has been nice.

**Ipad Air 2019**

I've had an on/off relationship with iPads, but right now I'm enjoying the air as a portable note taker and media device. It's also a nice carry to the coffee shop without a backpack or any other case.

**Dell U2515 25 inch monitor**

The QHD 2560 x 1440 resolution is perfect for docking my macbook pro. Since scaling increases CPU load and anything less than QHD feels cramped, this is the sweet spot I've been holding onto for the last few years.


**Logitech K380 Keyboard**

A solid and minimal wireless keyboard, and great alternative to apple keyboard which is much more expensive.

**Logitech M557**

This mouse just fits my hand really well. It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of high end mouse, but it's been very reliable.

**Topo Designs Backpack**

I try to spend some time outside of my home office when working, so a solid backpack is essential to me. The Topo Designs Y-Pack is built like a damn tank and looks pretty cool to. I've been rocking this for about 2 years now.

### Software

**VSCode**

I bought into the hype of VSCode and haven't looked back. It's fast, has great extensions, and just flat out works. Every other editor I've used has specific flaws, but I've found Microsoft has found a way to remove almost all of them in one package.

**PHPStorm**

If I really need to work on a PHP project that is very intricate, PHPStorm fits the bill. Even though it's slow and bulky, there's nothing I've found that matches the full feature set for PHP. I would normally just by a month subcriptinon and then drop it until I need it again.


**Transmit**

Transmit has the best interface for an FTP client that I've found. I bought it before they moved to subscription pricing, so that helps a lot too.

**Evernote**

There's no product or service that I've used for longer than Evernote. It's my digital filing cabinet for everything. The search, OCR capabilities, and tagging put it in a class all by itself. I could not live without it.

**Todoist**

Behind Evernote, I've been using Todoist a long time too. It's a simple task manager, but it has everything you need and nothing you don't. Too many other task managers fall short or try to introduce features which clutter up the interface. Todoist is the sweet spot.

### Other

There's plenty of other hardware & software items I could go into, but this list captures everything that is essential to me on a daily basis. I always love to hear what other people use too, so let me know if you make your own list!
