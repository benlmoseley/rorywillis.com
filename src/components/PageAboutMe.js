                        <b>I've worked in the technology side of media & entertainment since 2010</b> when I was hired at a small market TV station (WBKO). 
                        I started as a cameraman for the evening news and eventually went on to become a technical director. I knew I wanted latch on
                        to the digital side of TV, so I invested in learning automation, graphics technology, and scripting for the modern newscast.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>In 2015, I was hired as a Digital Solutions Specialist</b> for the parent company of WBKO, Gray Television. I was responsible for supporting
                        the campany's digital products, building & maintaining websites, as well as providing training.

                        <b>In 2018, I was promoted to Digital Engineer at Gray Television.</b> I am currently responsible for developing internal company software, third party
                        integrations, and maintaining infastructure. I get to use many differnet languages on the job, but I am primarily working in PHP & JS (React) at
                        the moment.

                        Outside of my professional life, I like to play and record music. I've played drums in various bands over the years and have recorded many albums for myself and others. 
                        Audio Engineering is my biggest hobby outside of computers. I also like to drink beer and hike, which is a big reason I love living in Colorado!
